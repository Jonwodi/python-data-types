#========================================

# using \n\t creates string on new line and also causes the new line to start with a tab. tabs, spaces and newlines are refered to whitespaces in python.

# sports = "\n\tbasketball\n\tboxing\n\tmma"

# assigning a variable to a value, then printing a message out that includes that variable.

# age = 23
# print(f"I'm age {age} years old")


#========================================

# you can use underscore a _ in intergers and floats, especially when dealing with long numerical values. For example, if wanted to assign the value Â£1000000 to variable, you can write it as shown below:

# a_million_pounds = 1_000_000.0
# a_million_pounds2 = 1_00_00_00
# a_million3 = 1_00_000_0
# print(a_million_pounds)
# print(a_million_pounds2)
# print(a_million3)

#========================================

# dividing two intergers returns their answer as a float e.g.

# print(4/2)

# also adding, subtracting. multiplying, dividing or exopenting a integer and float number always returns result as a float value e.g.

# print(8.0/2)
# print(2.0+2)
# print(12.0-8)
# print(2*2.0)
# print(2.0**2)

#========================================

# a CONSTANT is a variable, that has a value that never changes throught the life of a python program, meaning the value is stays constant. For variable to be constant, all its letters need to be in capital letters e.g.

# THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT_EXAMPLE1 = 23
